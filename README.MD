# torrentNFO

A Simple python script and module for polybar. 

## Description

I wanted an easy way to know when torrents where down downloading from my hosted qbBittorrent server. So I made a little script that lets you know what your downloads and uploads are. When clicked it should send a notification of what the last torrent added was. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* You will need to install python-qbittorrent:
```
pip install python-qbittorrent
```
* qBittorent webUI must be enabled before using this API client.
